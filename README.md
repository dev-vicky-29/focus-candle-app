# **Focus Candle App**

## **Project Overview**
The **Focus Candle App** is a simple, time-based productivity tool inspired by the concept of burning a candle while studying or working. The app allows users to choose a virtual candle that will "burn" for a specified amount of time, motivating them to focus until the timer runs out. This app helps promote deep work and focus by providing a visual and calming representation of time passing.

## **Why We Created This**
Many people struggle with maintaining focus during long study or work sessions. The idea of burning a candle until it extinguishes has been used as a mindfulness practice to help improve concentration and time management. This app replicates that experience in a virtual format, allowing users to stay engaged and motivated for a set period without the need for a real candle.

## **Features**
- **Virtual Candle Timer:** Users select a focus duration (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour) and watch the virtual candle "burn" as they work.
- **Soothing Interface:** A simple, minimalist design with a calming color palette to enhance the user's focus.
- **Customizable Focus Durations:** Multiple candle durations to suit different focus needs.

---

## **Frontend (UI Design)**
The app uses React for the front end, with basic components and styling. The UI design focuses on simplicity, offering:
- A **Candle Timer** component to visually represent time left.
- A **Dropdown Selector** for users to choose the candle burn duration.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is built to work on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

**Technologies Used:**
- **React**
- **CSS for Styling**
- **JavaScript**
